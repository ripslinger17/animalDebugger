# animalDebugger
Inspired by the CS50 Duck debugger, I created this project because I was bored and had never made a CLI application in Node.js before.

## What It Does

This CLI application will talk with you when you ask it anything. It lives in your terminal and provides a fun way to debug your code or just have a conversation.

## Available Options

You can choose from the following options for your debugger:

- Cat
- Dog
- Duck
- Rock

## Future Enhancements

- Add more animal options for the debugger.
- Implement a more sophisticated conversation engine.
- Enhance the user interface for a better terminal experience.
- Rewrite the code in a more readable and maintainable way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Initialize a new Node.js project.
2. Install the package using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/animaldebugging).
```bash
npm i animaldebugging
```
3. Run the CLI application using `npx`.
```bash
npx animaldebugging
```
